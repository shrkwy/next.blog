# 🖼️ Introduction

Images are a critical part of the modern web, and Next.js ships with a powerful tool for handling them: [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image). This built-in component offers significant performance improvements over traditional `<img>` tags by enabling automatic optimization, responsive loading, and built-in lazy loading.

In this guide, we'll walk through practical usage of `next/image`, highlight its strengths, and cover a few quirks you should know.

# ⚙️ How to Use `next/image`

## Static Imports

The most optimized approach in Next.js is importing images statically from your project:

```js
import Image from 'next/image'
import oceanPic from '../public/static/images/ocean.jpg'

export default function Gallery() {
  return <Image src={oceanPic} alt="Ocean View" placeholder="blur" />
}
```

Benefits:

- Automatic width/height inference
- Generates multiple sizes and uses modern formats like WebP/AVIF
- Enables blur-up placeholder by default

## Dynamic or Remote URLs

You can also load images from remote sources, but you must allow the domain in `next.config.js`:

```js
<Image src="https://example.com/images/pic.jpg" alt="Remote image" width={600} height={400} />
```

In `next.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ['example.com'],
  },
}
```

## Using in MDX

If you're using MDX (Markdown with JSX), you can embed the `Image` component directly:

```mdx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image src="/static/images/sunset.jpg" alt="Sunset" width={800} height={400} />
```

Alternatively, standard Markdown image syntax works, but it will fall back to a raw `<img>` tag unless you configure a custom MDX provider to swap it.

```md
![Ocean](./static/images/ocean.jpg)
```

# ✅ Benefits of `next/image`

- 🔍 **Optimized formats:** Serves modern formats (WebP/AVIF) automatically
- 📏 **Responsive sizing:** Delivers size-appropriate images based on device
- 💤 **Lazy loading:** Loads images only when visible on screen
- 📐 **Layout stability:** Helps avoid [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) by requiring fixed dimensions
- ⚡ **Built-in CDN integration:** Works seamlessly with Vercel’s Edge Network

---

# ⚠️ Limitations

- 🔒 **Public Folder Only:** All local images must be stored in the `public` directory
- 🌐 **Remote images need config:** You have to explicitly list external domains
- 🔁 **Server dependency:** The component requires server-side logic (serverless function or custom server)
- 🛠️ **Limited flexibility on non-Vercel platforms:** If self-hosting, you must either disable image optimization or configure your own loader/CDN

```js
// next.config.js example to disable optimization:
images: {
  unoptimized: true,
}
```

# 🧪 Experimental + Alternatives

Next.js is evolving. For build-time static generation or bundler-based processing, you might consider tools like:

- [`next-optimized-images`](https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-optimized-images) _(Webpack-based)_
- [Image CDN services like Imgix, Cloudinary, or ImageKit](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#loader)

These offer more control, but at the cost of setup complexity.

# 📸 Final Thoughts

The `next/image` component is a game-changer for modern frontend development. It's not just about image tags — it's about performance, accessibility, and developer experience.

Use it when you can. Understand its boundaries. And if it doesn't suit your deployment setup, you’ve got alternatives.

Happy optimizing!
