# 📝 Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to style text with plain syntax. It is widely used in blogging platforms, documentation, and code editors due to its simplicity and portability.

This guide serves as a **comprehensive reference** for Markdown syntax — from headers and emphasis to code blocks and task lists. It uses **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)**, enhanced with `mdx-prism` for syntax highlighting, and is compatible with systems like `next-mdx-remote` and `unified`.

# 📌 What is Markdown?

Markdown lets you write rich text using a plain text editor. You style the text with characters like `#`, `*`, or `[]()` — which are then parsed into HTML or rendered as formatted content on platforms like GitHub or your blog.

It's easy to learn, fast to write, and portable across platforms.

# 🧭 Syntax Guide

Here’s how to use common Markdown formatting elements, with explanations and examples for each.

## 🔠 Headers

Use `#` followed by a space to define headings:

```md
# H1 (Main title)

## H2 (Section title)

### H3 (Subsection)

#### H4 (Smaller heading)
```

# H1 (Main title)

## H2 (Section title)

### H3 (Subsection)

#### H4 (Smaller heading)

---

## ✨ Emphasis

Format text with italics, bold, or a combination of both:

```md
_Italic_ or _Italic_
**Bold**
_You **can** combine them_
```

_Italic_ or _Italic_  
**Bold**  
_You **can** combine them_

---

## 🔢 Lists

### Unordered List

Use `-`, `+`, or `*`:

```md
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2a
  - Subitem 2b
```

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2a
  - Subitem 2b

### Ordered List

Numbered automatically:

```md
1. First
2. Second
3. Third
   1. Subitem
```

1. First
2. Second
3. Third
   1. Subitem

---

## 🖼️ Images

Embed images using `![Alt](URL)` syntax:

```md
![GitHub Logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)
```

![GitHub Logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)

---

## 🔗 Links

Automatic or custom text links:

```md
http://github.com
[GitHub](http://github.com)
```

[http://github.com](http://github.com)  
[GitHub](http://github.com)

---

## 💬 Blockquotes

Prefix a line with `>`:

```md
> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.
```

> This is a blockquote.  
> It can span multiple lines.

---

## `Inline code`

Use backticks to style inline code:

```md
`<div>` is a block-level element.
```

`<div>` is a block-level element.

---

## 🔍 Syntax Highlighting

For code blocks with highlighting:

```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```

```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```

---

## 🦶 Footnotes

Markdown can support footnotes like so:

```md
Here's a statement with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote text.
```

Here's a statement with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote text.

---

## ✅ Task Lists

Create checkboxes using list syntax:

```md
- [x] Write content
- [ ] Review edits
- [ ] Publish post
```

- [x] Write content
- [ ] Review edits
- [ ] Publish post

---

## 📊 Tables

Tables use pipes `|` and hyphens `-` to define structure:

```md
| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |
```

| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |

---

## ❌ Strikethrough

Wrap text in double tildes `~~`:

```md
~~This text is crossed out~~
```

~~This text is crossed out~~

---

# 🧪 Advanced: MDX and Syntax Enhancers

If you're using **MDX** (Markdown with JSX), you can embed React components directly into Markdown. Combine this with tools like `mdx-prism`, `remark-gfm`, and `rehype-slug` to supercharge your content with syntax highlighting, auto-linked headings, and more.
