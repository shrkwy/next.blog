# 📚 Structuring Multi-Part Blog Posts with Nested Routes in Next.js

Managing long-form or related content can get messy without proper structure. That’s why this blog template now supports **nested routing for posts**, letting you organize your content in logical sub-folders — perfect for multi-part tutorials, team blogs, or language variants.

> 💡 This post itself is served from a nested route at `/data/blog/nested-route`, demonstrating exactly how it works.

---

## 🧱 How Nested Routing Works

To enable nested routes, simply create sub-folders within your main `/data/blog` directory. Each folder can contain `.md` or `.mdx` files representing posts in that group.

For example:

```bash
/data/blog/
  nested-route/
    index.mdx
    part-two.mdx
  another-series/
    part-one.mdx
    part-two.mdx
```

You can even go deeper:

```bash
/data/blog/nested-route/deeply-nested/my-post.md
```

This setup is powered by **Next.js catch-all dynamic routes** (`[[...slug]].tsx`), which automatically map your folder structure into accessible URLs.

---

## 🔄 Why Use Nested Routes?

Here are a few scenarios where nested blog routing becomes extremely useful:

- ✅ Logical content grouping (series, topics, categories)
- ✅ Multi-part tutorials or long-form guides
- ✅ Posts by different authors in their own namespaces
- ✅ Preparing your blog for **internationalization** (although [Next.js built-in i18n](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing) is preferred for production)

---

## 📅 Sorting and Navigation

By default, the blog template sorts posts by **publication date** regardless of folder. This means nested posts still appear in chronological order across the site.

However, for multi-part posts, you might want to customize the logic to link to the previous/next post in the series rather than date order.

> ⚠️ Currently, previous/next post links use date-based ordering. Customizing navigation for series progression is a possible enhancement.

## 🚀 Wrapping Up

Nested routing gives your blog structure and scalability without losing the simplicity of Markdown content. Whether you’re launching a multi-part course or just want better content organization, this feature fits right into your existing Next.js and Contentlayer setup.

Feel free to experiment and make your blog more modular!
